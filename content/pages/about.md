Let’s face it. Most non-finance staff don’t love finance. Many actively dislike and avoid financial reports and discussions.

At Accounting Made Easy, we have redefined finance training for all those who previously believed that in order to understand accounting basics and financial reports you must first be a math nerd.

To run a successful business, non-finance staff HAVE TO HAVE a real handle on their numbers and understand their reports and ratios.
